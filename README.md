# Trajectory Consolidation using Supervised Clustering Algorithms
## Problem Statement 
Aerial Vehicles follow a guided approach based on Latitude, Longitude and Altitude. This information can be used for calculating the status of maneuvering for the aerial vehicles along the line of trajectory. This is a binary classification problem and Machine Learning can be leveraged for solving such problem. In this a methodology for deriving maneuvering status and its prediction using Linear, Distance Metric, Discriminant Analysis and Boosting Ensemble supervised learning methods are mentioned. Provided various metrics along the line in the results section that give condensed comparison of the appropriate algorithm for prediction of the maneuvering status. Also used LSTM to find the cluster of predicted part.
