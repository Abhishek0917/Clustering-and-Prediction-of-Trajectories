# Clustering-and-Prediction-of-Trajectories
## Problem Statement 
The position of an object in the air can be indicated by latitude, longitude and altitude for a given time. A trajectory is a stream of such quadruples (time, latitude, longitude and altitude). Given a large set of such trajectories, without any other information, problem is to cluster them into meaningful objects such as Helicopter, Fighter/civilian Aircraft, UAV, Cruise Missile, dropped bomb, etc. An optimal scalable solution is desired using open source tools. Design a system to estimate location of flying object based on its trajectory, provide guidance to missile to shoot them depending on their location when missile will meet the object on its trajectory.
